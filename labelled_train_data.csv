Only probe sets with signal intensities above the 20th percentile in at least one of the 6 microarrays performed were retained, whereas all other probe sets were excluded from further analyses. Subsequently, the signal intensities of the replicate microarrays performed for each mouse group (SPC-HAxTCR-HA, SPC-HA) were averaged and the fold changes were calculated in reference to the data from the SPC-HA group. Only probe sets with a fold change greater than or equal to ±2 were retained. All other probe sets were excluded from further analyses.

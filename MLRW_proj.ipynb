Open the vial and transfer the content to a 15 ml Falcon tube already containing 5 ml of fresh medium.  3. Spin down at 1000 rpm or 200g for 3 to 5 mins at 4º C. Aspirate supernatant.  4. Resuspend cells in fresh medium and transfer to 150mm x 25mm tissue culture dish.  5. Check the cells under microscope.  6. Cells are cultured in CO2 incubator and medium is changed about every 3 days.  7. It usually takes 3 days or more for cells to recovery from freezing. After cell culture reaches  80-85%  confluence, subculture is conducted. Subculture ratio is about 1:3 or 1:4.  Passaging Cells:  1. Observe cells to see how confluent they are, whether the cells are alive, whether the cells are contaminated, and whether the cells have the correct morphology. After cell culture reaches 80 to 85% confluence, subculture is conducted  2. Remove media from dish  3. Wash 1x with 10 ml of PBS  4. Add 5 ml of Trypsin and trypsinize for 3 min at 37C. Whack hard – you should see the cells coming down. (Important: never overtrypsinize the cells, so work quickly)  5. Add 5 ml of media and use it to rinse the dish to detach the cells off (4 to 5 times)  6. Spin down at 1000rpm for 3 to 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate supernatant  7. Add 15 ml of media to 15ml tube containing cell pellet, and pipette up and down to mix  8. Add 15 ml of media to each new 150mm x 25mm tissue culture dish (we split 1 dish into 3 to 4 dishes)  9. Add 5mls of cell culturecontaining media to each tissue culture dish. Make sure the media covers the entire area of the dish. Put the cells into 37C with 5% CO2.']\n"
